Files in this repository:
* `install_corv.sh` : If dependencies are set up correctly, this script will install `corv` (Warning: This works on my machine, but I can't guarantee it will work on a non-Ubuntu system. If this doesn't work, you should be able to follow the instructions on the `corv` repo and download the interpolator [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ldsj7yucolzj6d/koester_interp_da.pkl)).
* `01_example.ipynb` : A few examples of using `corv` to fit DA and DB White Dwarfs.
* `02_validate.ipynb` : Compares `corv` performance to high-resolution RV measurements from Falcon et al, 2010
